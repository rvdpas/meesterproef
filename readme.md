# Meesterproef - Persgroep application

In this repository, you will find the code for De Persgroep application.
De Persgroep is a leading publisher of national, regional and local news brands, magazines, websites and is active on radio. The goal of this project is to create a app for a younger group of future writers. This app will give them the chance to create content younger people enjoy based on their interests. In the app users can write and read stories they think are relevant for their target audience. The whole idea behind this that young writers get the opportunity to create the content for the young readers.

## Concept
The concept is to involve younger to people to create news that they think is important. Yonger people know what they like and what they don't like. This way they are their own target audience. In the application you can add topics that you are interested in. After you've selected them, content will appear with that topic. Users can see how the aricle is doing by the amount of likes that it has. They have the ability to read the news, by going to the detail page. Here they like the article, comment on the article and like other peoples comments. The more the likes, the higher the comment.
